# 🗂️ Taskify  
### Where C++ meets productivity — a DSA-powered task scheduler ⚙️📊

Taskify is a **console-based task scheduling and management system** developed in **C++** as part of a **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** academic project.  
The project demonstrates how core data structures can be combined to solve a **real-world productivity problem** in an efficient and scalable way.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Taskify helps users **organize, prioritize, and track tasks** based on deadlines, categories, and completion status.  
Instead of being a simple to-do list, Taskify leverages **multiple data structures working together** to ensure fast access, reliable history tracking, and intelligent task prioritization.

This project bridges the gap between **theoretical DSA concepts** and **practical system design**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧑‍💼 User Functionality
- Add tasks with title, category, priority, and deadline  
- Automatically prioritize tasks using **Priority Queues (Heaps)**  
- View pending, completed, missed, and deleted tasks  
- Search tasks instantly using **Hash Tables**  
- Undo operations and maintain task history using **Stacks**  
- Generate summary reports via **file handling**  

### ⚙️ System Capabilities
- Menu-driven, user-friendly console interface  
- Efficient task insertion, deletion, and retrieval  
- Deadline monitoring and status updates  
- Modular and extensible code structure

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

- **Priority Queue (Heap)** – task prioritization  
- **Hash Table** – fast category-based searching  
- **Stack** – undo operations & history tracking  
- **Linked Lists / Arrays** – task storage  
- **File Handling** – persistent reports and logs  

Each data structure is used with a **clear purpose**, showcasing practical DSA design decisions.

---

## 🏗️ System Design

Taskify follows a **modular architecture**:

- Input & Menu Module – user interaction  
- Task Management Module – CRUD operations  
- Priority & Scheduling Module – heap-based logic  
- History & Undo Module – stack-based tracking  
- File Management Module – report generation  

This separation improves **readability, maintainability, and scalability**.
